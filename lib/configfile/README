This is a very simple tool for reading simple config files.
A file may contain a key/value pair like

name = 'fooba'
number = 5

In your C++ program they can be accessed like this:

ConfigFile cfg("test.cfg");
string conf_name=cfg.getvalue<string>("name");
int conf_number = cfg.getvalue<int>("number");


main.cpp shows a more detailed example usage.
